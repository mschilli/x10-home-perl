NAME
    X10::Home - Configure X10 for your Home

SYNOPSIS
        # /etc/x10.conf Configuration File
        module: ControlX10::CM11
        device: /dev/ttyS0
        receivers:  
          - name: bedroom_lights
            code: K15
            desc: Bedroom Lights

        use X10::Home;
        my $x10->X10::Home->new();
          # Address services by name
        $x10->send("bedroom_lights", "on");

DESCRIPTION
    "X10::Home" lets you set parameters of all your home X10 devices in a
    single configuration file. After that's done, applications can access
    them by name and without worrying about details like "house codes",
    "unit codes", "serial ports", X10 commands and other low-level details.

    For example, to switch the bedroom lights on, simply use

        use X10::Home;
        my $x10->X10::Home->new();
        $x10->send("bedroom_lights", "on");

    and

        $x10->send("bedroom_lights", "off");

    to switch them off again.

    "X10::Home" uses the "ControlX10::CM11" or "ControlX10::CM17" CPAN
    modules under the hood to send actual X10 commands via the computer's
    serial port.

  Configuration File
    Upon initialization, "X10::Home" will search a configuration file in the
    following locations (in the order listed):

    *   If "X10::Home::new()" gets called with the "conf_file" parameter
        set, the configuration will be read from "conf_file".

    *   "~/.x10.conf" (in the user's local home directory) if present

    *   "/etc/x10.conf" if present

    The configuration file is written in YAML format and looks like this:

        # /etc/x10.conf Configuration File

        module:   ControlX10::CM11
        device:   /dev/ttyS0
        baudrate: 4800

        receivers:  
          - name: bedroom_lights
            code: K15
            desc: Bedroom Lights
          - name: living_room_lights
            code: K16
            desc: Living Room Lights

    The "module" parameter specifies which X10 low-level module to use
    "ControlX10::CM11" or "ControlX10::CM17", it defaults to
    "ControlX10::CM11".

    The "device" parameter specifies the device entry of the serial port to
    use, it defaults to "/dev/ttyS0". This can be "/dev/ttyS4" or
    "/dev/ttyS5" if a serial PCI card gets plugged into the computer.

    The "baudrate" is the baud rate to be used to communicate over the
    serial port. It defaults to 4800.

    The "receivers" parameter specifies an array of receivers. The reason
    why this is an array an not a hash is that certain applications like to
    display all available receivers in a predefined order. Receivers are
    hashed internally by "X10::Home" for quick lookups, though.
